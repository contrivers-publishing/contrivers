# Contrivers' Review 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lmergner/contrivers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lmergner/contrivers)

The web technologies behind [Contrivers' Review](http://www.contrivers.org) are
divided into several different repositories.

1. A [Python html server app](http://www.github.com/lmergner/contrivers) that
   generates the www site.
2. A [Node API server](http://www.github.com/lmergner/contrives-api) that allows CRUD operations.
3. A [React CMS app](http://www.github.com/lmergner/contrivers-cms) that allows
   secure administration of the database.
4. [Stylesheets](http://www.github.com/lmergner/contrivers-styles)
5. A [set of migration
   scripts](http://www.github.com/lmergner/contrivers-migrations) for the
   database, written in bash, sql, and python's alembic library.

The apps and database are currently hosted on (www.heroku.com). The stylesheets will be hosted on Amazon S3.
